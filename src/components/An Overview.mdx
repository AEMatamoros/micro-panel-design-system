# Introduction to the Custom Design System

This document describes the components of the Custom design system. These
components form the foundation of our user interfaces, ensuring consistency,
accessibility, and ease of maintenance across all our applications.

## Components

In our Design System, we have developed several components using Tailwind CSS.
Some examples include:

-   **Buttons**: Designed to be accessible and consistent, with different style
    variations.
-   **Input Fields**: Form fields designed with validation and visual feedback.
-   **Cards**: Stylized containers for displaying varied content, such as text,
    images, and buttons.
-   **Modals**: Pop-up dialogs to capture user attention and display information
    or request confirmation.

Each of these components follows best design practices and adheres to
accessibility guidelines.

## Using Controls in Storybook

Storybook offers a powerful tool called **Controls** that allows you to
manipulate component properties directly from the Storybook interface. This
makes it easy to explore different variations and states of a component without
needing to modify the code.

### How to Use Controls

1. **Select a Component**: In the Storybook interface, select the component you
   want to explore.
2. **Explore the Controls**: In the "Controls" section, youâ€™ll find the
   properties you can modify, such as the button text, its color, size, etc.
3. **Adjust the Properties**: Change the control values to see how they affect
   the appearance and behavior of the component in real-time.

This functionality is especially useful for designers and developers who want to
experiment with components and find the optimal configurations for their needs.

Our Design System, based on Tailwind CSS, provides a solid foundation for the
development of consistent and accessible user interfaces. With Storybook and its
tools, like controls, you can efficiently explore and customize these
components, facilitating the agile design and development of high-quality
products.
